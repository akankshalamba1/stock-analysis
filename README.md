# stock-analysis

## Background: 
Steven Green energy corporation analysis is an analysis of 12 stocks in the stock market of Green Energy Corporations. Our client Steven, who is a finance graduate, his parents are considereing to invest their whole investment portfolio in the DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. They want Steven to handle there portfolio, whereas Steven want to invest the funds in a diversified portfolio, so he wants us to analyze several green energy stocks, in addition to DAQO stock. 
Steve loves the analysis workbook we prepared for him. At the click of a button, he was able to analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Our code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. So to resolve this issue we refactored our code to make it run quicker as the orignial code might take a long time to run if the data include thousands of values.

## Overview of Project: 
This project is based on the above mentioned analysis of the stocks. Our dataset consists of 3013 rows and 8 columns of 12 different stocks of green energy corporations namely **AY,CSIQ,DQ,ENPH,FSLR,HASI,JKS,RUN,SEDG,SPWR,TERP and VSLR** for the year 2017 and 2018. In our first analysis we used 1 Array "tickers" to run the entire code which provide us effective result but took a longer time as compared to our refactor code. For the 2017 data it took system 1.324219 seconds to run the code and for 2018 analysis it took the system 1.613281 seconds to run the code. As shown below
